Question : What is Self-attention?

Answer:
The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:
• In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,
and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every
position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the
typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as
[38, 2, 9].
• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values
and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the
encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the
encoder.
• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to
all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward

Question : What is Self-attention?

Answer:
Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. In the context of the Transformer model, self-attention allows each position in the input to attend to all positions in the previous layer, enabling the model to capture dependencies and relationships within the sequence effectively. This mechanism has been successfully applied to various tasks, including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations.
